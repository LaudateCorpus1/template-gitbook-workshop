# Prelaunch Checklist

The purpose of our [Precourse Material](#precourse-material) is to make sure that everyone is familiar with the key concepts we will be using throughout your time. A solid grounding in the fundamentals will help you immensely.

Please make sure you have finished the [Precourse Material](#precourse-material), or can self-attest to their associated learning outcomes, and installed the software on our [Installation List](#installation-list) *prior to the start of your workshop*.

## Installation List
CrowdStrike workshops are delivered entirely online. No special software is needed beyond general purpose utilities included in your operating system, or those freely available.

1. This course will access operating systems via SSH. As such you will need access to an SSH client.
   * [PuTTY](https://www.putty.org/) is a well known and free SSH client for the Windows platform.
   * OSX and Linux users can use their operating system's native SSH client.

2. The Falcon Web Console officially supports, and was developed for, the [Chrome Web Browser](https://www.google.com/chrome/). While other standards-compliant web browsers *should* work, Chrome is officially tested and supported. Usage of Chrome ensures a standard experience for workshop attendees and is strongly encouraged.

3. For sessions delivered remotely, [Zoom](https://zoom.us/download) provides video conferencing capabilities. There are standalone clients freely available for most operating systems, and plugins available for popular web browsers.

*You're going to be spending a lot of time in a web browser*, usually with many tabs open. Modern browsers can be pretty memory-hungry (looking at you, Chrome), so having more RAM tends to make for a smoother experience. If your laptop runs out of RAM it'll start suspending apps/tabs in the background, which isn't ideal.

**We recommend your laptop has a minimum of 4GB of RAM**. You can't really have too much here though, 8GB+ would probably be ideal.
